# Soft drink machine

This is an assessment question for my Theory of Computing class

## Background

A soft drink machine dispenses cans of drinks at the JKUAT cafeteria.
The machine waits for students and/or staff to insert coins.
All soft drinks cost Ksh. 50, and clients can buy more than one soft drink.

The machine can accept the following local denominations:

- Ten, Twenty and Fourty-shilling coins
- All the local currency notes i.e. 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000

A client must insert a minimum of Ksh.50 to for the machine to dispense drinks
The machine should also dispense the balance (change) to the clients if need be

## Questions

1. Give the formal definition of the above machine, as a finite automaton.
2. Is the machine deterministic or non-deterministic? Justify your answer.
3. Draw a state transition diagram for the above machine
4. Using a programming language of your choice, write a computer program to implement the above machine.
5. Simulate this problem with an appropriate user interface
